# TA Session Intro

I believe many of you are confused about the requirement of building a project in this course.
Especially this is a DBMS course, instead of Software Analysis & Design (SAD).

There is a long long history of the existance of project in this course, and I'll skip that part.
In sum, Prof. Chou believes this is a chance for you to prepare your project, plus, some students may not take the project in SAD course seriously.
He therefore decided to setup this requirement.

So SAD that you cannot suffer in SAD class only... don't be serious, just a lame joke.

We, TAs, understand this is a HEAVY load for most of you, who may have no experience in coding a full-stack project.
Therefore, we're here to help you.

The TA sessions will teach you some essential skills you need to build a full-stack web application.

Disclaimer: The following is TA Harvey's personal opinion, another TA & Prof. may not agree

Setting up the environment on your personal computer is a thing that may only learn by doing.

I'll give you my settings and configs, if that doesn't work for you, you may want to look for the answer by yourself first.

Specifically, in most cases, what we do is Google it in front of you.

If you still cannot figure out, please tell me what is(are) the problem(s) and which methods you've tried and the results.

By then, I'll try my best to help you.

Good luck!
